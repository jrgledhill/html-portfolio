    <h2>Here are 3 of my most favorite action movies</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Band of Brothers</h3>

    <p>
      This is a great mini-series about a group of soldiers who fought during
      World War II. I enjoyed the story and the characters.

    <h3>Gladiator</h3>

    <p>
      A fantastic movie about a Roman General who was betrayed, enslaved, and
      forced to fight in the Arenas of Rome as a Gladiator.
    </p>

    <h3>The Patriot</h3>

    <p>
      Peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin is driven to lead the Colonial Militia
      during the American Revolution when a sadistic British officer murders his
      son.
